Unsupervised Learning Techniques,2024-06-24,https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781098125967/,https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781098125967/ch09.html,https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781098125967/ch09.html#494a033b-4abc-4cd1-8358-dea4039bd36d,"The computational complexity of the algorithm is generally linear with regard to the number of instances m, the number of clusters k, and the number of dimensions n. However, this is only true when the data has a clustering structure. If it does not, then in the worst-case scenario the complexity can increase exponentially with the number of instances. In practice, this rarely happens, and k-means is generally one of the fastest clustering algorithms.",
